Cases to Consider from the pre-treatment:

CASE265: weird missing some segmentation inbetween proper images

CASE272: only 6 images

CASE481: somehow is getting the same output as 480

CASE533: missing the HU truth value in the header (volume could've corrupted, check later)

CASE535: weird missing some segmentation inbetween proper images

CASE560: lists everything but the houseinfield unit metadata: 0028|1054

CASE578: weird missing some segmentation inbetween proper images

CASE629: probably got corrupted, same with mha
