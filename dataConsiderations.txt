Cases to Consider from the pre-treatment:

CASE265: weird missing some segmentation inbetween proper images [fixed now]

CASE272: only 3 images

CASE481: [Removed because it is empty]

CASE533: whole segment is corrupted/is completely empty

CASE535: weird missing some segmentation inbetween proper images [fixed now]

CASE560: lists everything but the houseinfield unit metadata: 0028|1054 XXX [But I dont think this matters]

CASE578: weird missing some segmentation inbetween proper images [fixed now] 

CASE629: whole segment is corrupted/is completely empty


Cases for the post-treatment:

Some images in post has .mha.mha (546157) [now fixed]
Some have NM, some have JM (546191-546237, ignoring the no segmentation ones), and some do not have either.

CASE472: looks completely white

CASE480: has last 2 images as just dots

CASE523: image is converted into a completely black pictures [due to the resampling not being done right]

CASE533: image is converted into a completely black pictures [due to the resampling not being done right]

CASE546: there is only 1 image in the segmentSlices array, make sure that it turned into a 3D array [It might just be 1 frame, also from the slicer it doesn't line up with the 
whole image at all, view slicer to confirm, but that might just be from the space origin that is fixed when we run it here] 

[]Yet to do other cases[]
