Cases to Consider from the pre-treatment:

CASE265: weird missing some segmentation inbetween proper images

CASE272: only 6 images

CASE481: somehow is getting the same output as 480

CASE533: probably got corrupted, same with mha XXXX

CASE535: weird missing some segmentation inbetween proper images

CASE560: lists everything but the houseinfield unit metadata: 0028|1054 XXX

CASE578: weird missing some segmentation inbetween proper images

CASE629: probably got corrupted, same with mha XXX


Cases for the post-treatment:

Some images in post has .mha.mha (546157) [now fixed]
Some have NM, some have JM (546191-546237, ignoring the no segmentation ones), and some do not have either.
