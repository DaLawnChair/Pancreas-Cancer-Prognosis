Cases to Consider from the pre-treatment:

CASE265: weird missing some segmentation inbetween proper images

CASE272: only 6 images

CASE481: somehow is getting the same output as 480

CASE533: probably got corrupted, same with mha XXXX

CASE535: weird missing some segmentation inbetween proper images

CASE560: lists everything but the houseinfield unit metadata: 0028|1054 XXX

CASE578: weird missing some segmentation inbetween proper images

CASE629: probably got corrupted, same with mha XXX


Cases for the post-treatment:

Some images in post has .mha.mha (546157) [now fixed]
Some have NM, some have JM (546191-546237, ignoring the no segmentation ones), and some do not have either.

CASE472: looks completely white

CASE480: has last 2 images as just dots

CASE523: image is converted into a completely black pictures [Completely wrong]

CASE533: image is converted into a completely black pictures [Completely wrong]

CASE546: there is only 1 image in the segmentSlices array, make sure that it turned into a 3D array [It might just be 1 frame, also from the slicer it doesn't line up with the 
whole image at all, view slicer to confirm, but that might just be from the space origin that is fixed when we run it here]
