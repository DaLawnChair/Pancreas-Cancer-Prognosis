Current progress:
* Added paper results and formatted files inside of abstractResults. All files including the preprocessCombinations are in the abstractResults.zip folder stored locally
* Each fold now keeps track of fpr, tpr, and thresholds, useful for graph making later on

Need to do [current]:
* try SGD and other params not covered
Later on optimizations
* look into meta-analysis - how and why the model inferences for particular images
